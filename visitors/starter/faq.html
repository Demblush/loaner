         1 active downline, you will be able to withdraw only N1,000. If
          you have 2 active downlines, you will be able to withdraw only 
          N2,000. If you have 3 active downlines, you will be able to withdraw
           only N3,000. If you have 4 active downlines,

 <div class="panel verdana">
   <p class='verdana'>Click on "I Have Paid" and upload the proof of payment. Proof of payment is 
          a picture that shows you have made the payment. It could be a debit or
           email alert.</p>

 <button class="accordion">You don't have proof of payment?</button>

 <div class="panel verdana">
   <p class='verdana'>Once the member's deadline for payment expires, please click on
           "Not Paid", then click on Withdraw again, so that you can be paired with another member. Note: if you fail to click on "Not Paid", 
          the transaction will be automatically confirmed within 72 hours. And there is no refund.</p>
 </div>
 <button class="accordion">You clicked 'not paid' and now you see <br> 'finally paid'?</button>
 <div class="panel verdana">
   <p class='verdana'>It's meant to make room for late payment,

 <div class="panel verdana">
   <p class='verdana'>The member paired to you did not pay you but went ahead and clicked on "I have paid"?
        Sometimes there might be a delay in network, and that could be the reason you haven't seen alert. But once his/her time has expires, make sure you click on Not Paid and wait for 24 hours before contacting us.
        
        If it's up to 24 hours, and you still haven't seen alert, please contact us and you will be paired with another member.</p>

 <button class="accordion">Problem with unactivated  downline <br> on Loanmedium?</button>
 <div class="panel verdana">
   <p class='verdana'>If the person you invited has paid and you haven't received the person as an active downline, simply
